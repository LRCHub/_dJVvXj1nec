Embers of evil, coming my way
Where do you hide, what do you see?
Spiral skies, black gravitation
Can you trust the Savante Mezmerist?

Friend of darkness, in the chapel
Your magic's cold and worn, so stained
Hidden key, a haze of amber
The gate to hell opens today

Wizard of the vortex
Giving your soul, the spark of it all
Guardian of the godless
Stared into the pit, saw the abyss
Wizard of the vortex
Spreading your wings, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down

Did you surrender, when the demon rose?
Like a sphinx in silver light you held the deep?
Oh with flames, you gave catharsis
And stole our hopes and dreams from our sleep

Wizard of the vortex
Giving your soul, the spark of it all
Guardian of the godless
Stared into the pit, saw the abyss
Wizard of the vortex
Spreading your wings, down, down, down, down, down

I'm the wizard of the vortex
I'm the omen, I'm the sign
I'm the wizard of the vortex
I'm the symptom of our times
